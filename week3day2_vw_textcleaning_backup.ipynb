In this case, we will not be focusing with any depth on the AI/ML consequences of this work, but will instead focus on some foundational topics that will be incredibly useful to appreciate in the run up to an understanding of machine learning. These foundational topics point to the _motivations_ for text analysis as well as the considerations with textual data. \n",

    "## Encodings: Considering Text and Language\n",
    "\n",
    "Language is what people speak as well as what they understand when they read. However, people do not read languages they read text. They do not hear languages, they hear speech. In both cases, language refers to a set of signs that have meaning, but (and this comes from semiotics), we never observe signs directly. Instead, they are a _relation_ between what we call a signifier and a signified. The signifier might be the word \"horse\", the signified might be an actual equine animal grazing in a field. The sign \"horse\" is the semantic association we make between the word \"horse\" (whether read on a sign \"beware of wild horses\" or in speech, where someone says \"did you notice the horse in that field over there\"). \n",
    "\n",
    "Within natural language processing, we are interested in these signs (i.e. what does a 'horse' mean?) and how we can understand them from the data we collect (\"How has our discussion of horses changed after we started driving cars\" or \"do animal rights groups and jockeys use the same set of associations when talking about horses\"). But while we are interested in these signs (i.e. the semantic elements of language), we cannot access them directly. They are implicit. Instead we access _data_ which in this case typically means text. NLP can also consider other metatextual elements such as speed, pitch, emphasis, differences in dialect or spelling. But typically we are focused on text and how that text helps us to understand the world better, or how we can use tools in NLP to understand a text better. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we translate language into text we need to encode it somehow. So instead of me saying <audio controls>\n",
    "    <source src=\"audio_sample.m4a\" type=\"audio/mpeg\">\n",
    "    Your browser does not support the audio element.\n",
    "</audio>, we read \"Hello everyone\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Text is therefore an encoding of language. But it is an encoding that is useful for humans. Computers on the other hand need ways to encode text. Thus, before we even get to the analysis of text it is worth appreciating encodings if only superficially. "

    "# Processing and \"Pre-Processing\" Text \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to work with text we need to somehow appreciate its _context_. That context can vary from 'the other words around this text'. For example in a humourous episode of The Simpsons, some aliens abduct the family and have them on board the ship. The plot follows the concerns that the Simpsons are going to be on the menu. Daughter Lisa discovers a book and warns the rest of the family. The book says \"How to Cook Humans\". The family confront the aliens who then dust the book revealing it is \"How to Cook For Humans\". Then one of the Simpsons blows off more dust to reveal \"How to Cook Forty Humans\" followed by \"How to Cook for Forty Humans\". See clip at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o0QcdgeI5Rs In each exchange between Kang the Alien and Lisa, the semantics of the word \"humans\" changes depending on the word in front of it, either as alien meal or as guests to a party. \n",
    "\n",
    "How we understand the context for a text is a challenging and expansive subject of inquiry. There are many approaches to this and they range greatly in sophistication. Below is a crude scale of context: \n",
    "\n",
    "0. **No context**. We can think of words as separate semantic entities. (i.e \"Bag of words\")\n",
    "1. **Adjacent words**. Words will have words before and after them. Combining these together we get N-grams. So \"cook humans\", \"for humans\", and \"forty humans\" would all be 2-grams. \n",
    "2. **Adjacent words as blocks of text**. One does not need to specify the exact number of n-grams. A sentence could be short or long, but it is a single sentence and thus a single collection of words that typically mean things when read together. What is important is the sensemaking that occurs through grammar. In english, consider the sentences \"The colour paints well\" and \"The paints colour well\". Here the order gives us a signal that colour is a noun and a subject in the first case, but a verb in the second case. \n",
    "3. **Words-in-documents**. Some documents will use some rare words a lot while most documents use some common words. Simply knowing that two words appear in the same document is a useful context. It is also the basis of TF-IDF which we will see at the end. \n",
    "4. **Words and their performance**. Words can be uttered as speech. This means that not only will other words be the context, but we might also have metatextual features like pitch. Referencing another pop culture moment, in the sitcom friends, there was an extended discussion about leaving the house when two of the cast forgot their keys. Monica leaves the house asking Rachel behind her \"got the keys?\" https://youtu.be/JjpnslsuA2g?t=30 . When they get back Rachel said Monica don't you have the keys asserting \"You said 'got the keys'\" as if it was an assertion not a question. Thus, the lack of attention to the context of pitch and tone left them with a misunderstanding that locked them out of the house. \n",
    "\n",
    "When we process text we must attend to the level of context we wish to consider for that word. As the examples given above show, the very same word \"humans\" in the first case, and \"keys\" in the second is understood in relation to context. \n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the stability of the meaning of a word, more or less context might be required. Where less context is required we can say that a word's meaning is stable or unambiguous. Where more context is required we can say that a word's meaning is unstable or ambiguous. When we take in text, we want to be mindful that we are abstracting from context, but we want to ensure that we are not abstracting so far that our ability to understand meaning in the text is compromised.\n",
    "\n",
    "This has considerable consequences for our understanding of data. If we believe that hate speech is an unpleasant force in the world, we may be inclined to want to 'ban' hate speech. However, when doing so, we may find that people start to use different terms for the same sentiment. For example, while the word \"killed\" is now banned on TikTok, this has led to people using the term \"unalived\" to refer to the same 'sign' but with a different signifier. Similarly, on the subreddit /r/Stupidpol where ostensibly leftist reactionaries critique identity politics from their perspective, a ban on discussion of trans issues has led people to use the term \"train enthusiasts\" or \"model train operators\" to refer to members of the trans community. We see this all over the world. In China one classic example now is the use of the Grass Mud Horse (草泥马, cǎo ní mǎ) as a substitute for a vulgar curse word. While I won't get into details of the curse word (which you might infer), Horse in Chinese is mǎ, whereas mother is mā. \n",
    "\n",
    "To that end, while we may have an interest in reducing _hate speech_, this is really an exercise in reducing _the performance of hated_. To that end, we are not trying to process hate-text, but use text to understand hate-language. This is important for social data science as it relates to our classic challenge of operationalisation and the related issue of construct validity. It also therefore can inform a number of decisions that we need to make in order to more fully appreciate the meaning behind words both _in context_ and _at scale_. It is also worth considering that within linguistics there is an entire subfield dedicated to \"pragmatics\" which is how the context of a word's use can influence its meaning. \n",
    "\n",
    "I mention this now because the first few techniques that we will show may superficially seem like they are very useful and powerful, but they end up being limited and preliminary. By being able to show these steps, we can then reflect on whether such steps are useful and needed in our own work. We also need to interrogate whether our work is sufficient to help inform others about any given research topic and about appropriate methods to address our _object of inquiry_. So let's proceed with some text processing, but please bear in mind that these tools are not the end of an analysis but the beginning. \n",
    "\n",
    "I also mention this because, and this is speaking in an editorial voice, I really dislike word clouds and wish to discourage their use in future academic work. While my rationale for this should be evident from the above discussion, I can spell it out more clearly: Word clouds divorce words from context, provide an inconsistent message to the viewer beyond \"big words important\", and make considerable assumptions that it is the words themselves and not how they are used which makes a difference. Imagine a word cloud for comments to an airline. In the middle we see \"Luggage\" and \"Service\". A superficial reading might say \"look how much people care about their luggage\" and \"people notice our commitment to good service\". When in fact the terms are there because most people are commenting to complain \"you lost my luggage and the service was terrible\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Where we want to end up is a place where we can make comments on our object of inquiry through text, but not simply comments on text. Thus, we will start with simple forms of text processing, but then see these as potential forms of pre-processing for more complex tasks. It is these more complex tasks that we ultimately want to consider when our skills get there."

    "Words in English and in most languages can be considered as discrete elements. They may not be written this way. For example in Arabic words are chained together in written speech making such discretisation challenging. In English spaces are typically used to denote separate words. When there is no space we may consider it a compound word like \"something\" as a compound of \"some\" and \"thing\" or as portmonteau, where two words are blended such as \"hacktivism\". We typcially still consider compound words and portmonteaus as single words. English also has contractions where sometimes compounded words eliminate letters, such as _cannot_ be written as \"can't\" and _will not_ being written as \"won't\". From a semantic point of view \"cannot\" and \"can't\" may or may not be considered equivalent. In logical speech that may be the case, but in a peer reviewed paper, we would expect people to use expanded terms like cannot and avoid contractions which are seen as informal. \n",

But we can also strip any set of characters by providing them as an argument. By providing `string.punctuation`, we can strip this from both sides of the word. We could use `lstrip()` and `rstrip()` for the left and right sides respectively. However, we still have some words that are seen as generally comparable except for their capitalisation, such as \"It\" and \"it\". Capitalisation is important to consider when dealing with proper names. \"Mom\" and \"mom\" would refer to qualitatively different things, where \"Mom\" would be a title/name as in \"Mom said I could take the car\" whereas in the latter, \"Before taking the car you should ask your mom\". The latter is a role. There are many moms in the world, but for anyone there typically only one person referred to as \"Mom\".

    "- **LIWC**: A huge and versitile API to scoring for all kinds of concepts such as \"anxiety\" or \"skepticism\". It started as a simple senitment analyser but has expanded considerably. \n",
    "- **Model-based scoring**: This is an active area of research, but we can generally get decent scores out of models like SentiBert which are trainined on vast corpus of texts with an architecture that reports a numeric sentiment score as the text passes through the model. Notably this is _not_ lexical scoring. It is not just giving the words scores but working on word embeddings, which is something we will explore later. "

A simple and yet highly versatile approach is TF-IDF: \n",

    "Inverse document frequency is a bit more tricky. It gives a weight to the presence of terms so that those which show up in most documents have a lower weight than those that show up in fewer documents. Note that $N$ is the numerator whereas the counting is in the denominator. This means that if $|{d ∈ D: t ∈ d}|$ is high it suggests these terms are in most of the docs, thus when we divide N by this count we will get a _lower_ score. Thus the term is more common and therefore makes the term less 'distinct' in any given document and thus probably less meaningful. \n",
